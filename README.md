This repo hosts the Windows and macOS installers for the NAAP, ClassAction, and Interactives projects of the Astronomy Education Group at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Look for the "Releases" link (probably on the right).

The source files for the Flash materials and the AIR app packages are in different repos of this account.

(AIR apps are a way of packaging Flash content to run on a computer as a native app. This method was more important before highly capable Flash emulators like Ruffle were developed.)
